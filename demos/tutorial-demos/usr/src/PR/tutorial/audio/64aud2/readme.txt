Operations 

* Use the up/down keys on the cross-key to move between menu items
* Use the right/left keys on the cross-key to change values 
* Use the A button to play back the selected song or sound effect
* Use the B button to stop playback of the selected song or sound effect
* Use the Z trigger to stop all sounds
* In the SE1 menu, use the 3D stick to change the volume and the pan
* In the SE3 menu, move the 3D stick up/down to change the rpm of the engine
  The tone of the sound effect will also change to match 

Other precautions

* If a type of reverb is selected in the SONG1 menu, that setting will immediately be reflected
* Each time a synchronization marker is reached during playback in SONG2, the background color will change
* Since random parameters are assigned to SE2 by N64 SoundTools, the volume and pan will 
  change each time it is played
* A sound effect file with a sustain loop is used for the engine sound in SE3
* When the 3D stick is tilted down in SE3, at the point at which the rpm's drop below 2000 rpm,
  the sound effect will switch to "enst" (engine stall)
